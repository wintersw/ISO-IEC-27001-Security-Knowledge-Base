# A.8.2 Privileged access rights

## Overview

Privileged access permits high-impact changes or access beyond ordinary user rights. It should be limited, separately approved, strongly authenticated, attributable, time-bound where practical, monitored, and regularly reviewed.

## Purpose

The purpose of A.8.2 is to reduce the likelihood or impact of failures related to **privileged access rights**. A well-designed control makes the expected outcome, accountability, operating trigger, exception path, and assurance method clear enough to be repeated and tested.

## ISO requirement, implementation guidance, and best practice

- **ISO requirement:** Annex A controls are not automatically mandatory. Determine necessary controls through risk treatment, record applicability in the Statement of Applicability, and implement A.8.2 when selected or otherwise committed to.
- **Implementation guidance:** Define **privileged access rights** through its owner, scope, trigger, workflow, exceptions, and evidence.
- **Best practice:** Embed it in normal work, test operation and effectiveness, and review it after material change or failure.

## Practical implementation

### Measures that support decisions

- access reviews completed on time
- orphaned accounts
- privileged accounts without strong authentication
- time to remove leaver access

## Practical example

An engineer requests two hours of production administrator access for an approved change. A separate approver confirms need, the privileged session is logged, access expires automatically, and exceptions receive follow-up review.

## Evidence to retain

- identity inventory or authoritative export
- access request and approval
- access review record
- removal or modification ticket
- authentication and privileged-session logs
