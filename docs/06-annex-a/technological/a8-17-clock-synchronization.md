# A.8.17 Clock synchronization

## Overview

Consistent time lets records from different systems be ordered and correlated. Systems should use approved, trustworthy time sources, monitor synchronization health, protect settings, and account for time zones and known offsets.

## Purpose

The purpose of A.8.17 is to reduce the likelihood or impact of failures related to **clock synchronization**. A well-designed control makes the expected outcome, accountability, operating trigger, exception path, and assurance method clear enough to be repeated and tested.

## ISO requirement, implementation guidance, and best practice

- **ISO requirement:** Annex A controls are not automatically mandatory. Determine necessary controls through risk treatment, record applicability in the Statement of Applicability, and implement A.8.17 when selected or otherwise committed to.
- **Implementation guidance:** Define **clock synchronization** through its owner, scope, trigger, workflow, exceptions, and evidence.
- **Best practice:** Embed it in normal work, test operation and effectiveness, and review it after material change or failure.

## Key concepts

- **Applicability:** why the control is or is not needed in context.
- **Control owner:** the role accountable for design, operation, evidence, and improvement.
- **Operating evidence:** scoped, dated records showing what occurred and who approved it.
- **Effectiveness:** achievement of the intended outcome, not activity completion alone.

## Practical implementation

This control creates visibility into security-relevant activity. Logs and alerts should be designed around investigation and risk scenarios, protected from tampering, retained appropriately, and reviewed through defined workflows.

For A.8.17, begin by identifying the specific risk, legal requirement, contractual commitment, or operational need that makes the control necessary. The control owner should then define what is in scope, which roles perform the activity, which systems or data sources are authoritative, how exceptions are handled, and what evidence proves that the control operated.

## Practical example

Servers and security tools synchronize to approved redundant time sources. Monitoring detects excessive drift, changes require privilege and logging, and incident records retain coordinated universal time with local display conversion.

## Evidence to retain

- approved policy, standard, or procedure
- owner and responsibility record
- operating records from the relevant workflow
- exception and risk-acceptance records
- control test or audit evidence

Retain both design and operating evidence; policy alone does not prove operation. Prefer authoritative, scoped records with approvals, exceptions, and remediation.

## Common mistakes

- policy exists without reliable operation;
- ownership or scope is unclear;
- exceptions lack approval or expiry; and
- evidence or corrective action does not demonstrate effectiveness.

## Auditor questions

- Which risk or requirement does the control address?
- Who owns and operates it, and how is scope determined?
- Which evidence shows recent operation and exception handling?
- How is effectiveness tested and failure remediated?
- What changed after the latest significant review or event?
