# A.8.18 Use of privileged utility programs

## Overview

Privileged utility programs can bypass ordinary application and operating-system controls. Their availability and use should be restricted, approved, logged, reviewed, and removed where no legitimate need exists.

## Purpose

The purpose of A.8.18 is to reduce the likelihood or impact of failures related to **use of privileged utility programs**. A well-designed control makes the expected outcome, accountability, operating trigger, exception path, and assurance method clear enough to be repeated and tested.

## ISO requirement, implementation guidance, and best practice

- **ISO requirement:** Annex A controls are not automatically mandatory. Determine necessary controls through risk treatment, record applicability in the Statement of Applicability, and implement A.8.18 when selected or otherwise committed to.
- **Implementation guidance:** Define **use of privileged utility programs** through its owner, scope, trigger, workflow, exceptions, and evidence.
- **Best practice:** Embed it in normal work, test operation and effectiveness, and review it after material change or failure.

## Practical implementation

### Measures that support decisions

- access reviews completed on time
- orphaned accounts
- privileged accounts without strong authentication
- time to remove leaver access

## Practical example

A database repair utility is absent from standard administrator roles. Emergency use requires an incident ticket and temporary approval, runs through a monitored privileged session, and is reviewed after access expires.

## Evidence to retain

- identity inventory or authoritative export
- access request and approval
- access review record
- removal or modification ticket
- authentication and privileged-session logs
