# A.8.20 Networks security

## Overview

Network security protects data flows and connected services through architecture, configuration, access control, monitoring, maintenance, and response. Controls should reflect trust boundaries and service needs rather than relying on a single perimeter.

## Purpose

The purpose of A.8.20 is to reduce the likelihood or impact of failures related to **networks security**. A well-designed control makes the expected outcome, accountability, operating trigger, exception path, and assurance method clear enough to be repeated and tested.

## ISO requirement, implementation guidance, and best practice

- **ISO requirement:** Annex A controls are not automatically mandatory. Determine necessary controls through risk treatment, record applicability in the Statement of Applicability, and implement A.8.20 when selected or otherwise committed to.
- **Implementation guidance:** Define **networks security** through its owner, scope, trigger, workflow, exceptions, and evidence.
- **Best practice:** Embed it in normal work, test operation and effectiveness, and review it after material change or failure.

## Practical example

A cloud network exposes only the application gateway publicly, separates management and data paths, restricts flows to documented dependencies, logs denied connections, and tests that direct database access is blocked.

## Evidence to retain

- approved policy, standard, or procedure
- owner and responsibility record
- operating records from the relevant workflow
- exception and risk-acceptance records
- control test or audit evidence
